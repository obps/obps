The scientific study of complex computer systems should therefore be based on observation of how they are used in practice, as opposed to how they are assumed to be used or how they were designed to be used. In particular, detailed workload logs from real computer systems are invaluable for research on performance evaluation and for designing new systems. Regrettably, workload data may suffer from quality issues that might distort the study results, just as scientific observations in other fields may suffer from measurement errors. The cumulative experience with the Parallel Workloads Archive, a repository of job-level usage data from large-scale parallel supercomputers, clusters, and grids, has exposed many such issues. Importantly, these issues were not anticipated when the data was collected, and uncovering them was not trivial. As the data in this archive is used in hundreds of studies, it is necessary to describe and debate procedures that may be used to improve its data quality. Specifically, we consider issues like missing data, inconsistent data, erroneous data, system configuration changes during the logging period, and unrepresentative user behavior. Some of these may be countered by filtering out the problematic data items. In other cases, being cognizant of the problems may affect the decision of which datasets to use. While grounded in the specific domain of parallel jobs, our findings and suggested procedures can also inform similar situations in other domains. "

abstract="Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.",

@phdthesis{nix,
    abstract = {{Software deployment is the set of activities related to getting software components to work on the machines of end users. It includes activities such as installation, upgrading, uninstallation, and so on. Many tools have been developed to support deployment, but they all have serious limitations with respect to correctness. For instance, the installation of a component can lead to the failure of previously installed components; a component might require other components that are not present; and it is generally difficult to undo deployment actions. The fundamental causes of these problems are a lack of isolation between components, the difficulty in identifying the dependencies between components, and incompatibilities between versions and variants of components.
This thesis describes a better approach based on a purely functional deployment model, implemented in a deployment system called Nix. Components are stored in isolation from each other in a Nix store. Each component has a name that contains a cryptographic hash of all inputs that contributed to its build process, and the content of a component never changes after it has been built. Hence the model is purely functional.
This storage scheme provides several important advantages. First, it ensures isolation between components: if two components differ in any way, they will be stored in different locations and will not overwrite each other. Second, it allows us to identify component dependencies. Undeclared build time dependencies are prevented due to the absence of  ” global” component directories used in other deployment systems. Runtime dependencies can be found by scanning for cryptographic hashes in the binary contents of components, a technique analogous to conservative garbage collection in programming language implementation. Since dependency information is complete, complete deployment can be performed by copying closures of components under the dependency relation.
Developers and users are not confronted with components' cryptographic hashes directly. Components are built automatically from Nix expressions, which describe how to build and compose arbitrary software components; hashes are computed as part of this process. Components are automatically made available to users through  ” user environments”, which are synthesised sets of activated components. User environments enable atomic upgrades and rollbacks, as well as different sets of activated components for different users.
Nix expressions provide a source-based deployment model. However, source-based deployment can be transparently optimised into binary deployment by making pre-built binaries (keyed on their cryptographic hashes) available in a shared location such as a network server. This is referred to as transparent source/binary deployment.
The purely functional deployment model has been validated by applying it to the deployment of more than 278 existing Unix packages. In addition, this thesis shows that the model can be applied naturally to the related activities of continuous integration using build farms, service deployment and build management.}},
